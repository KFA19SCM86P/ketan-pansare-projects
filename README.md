Enterprise Web Applications
I have created multiple projects or modules of projects in this directory.
Created a website similar to BestBuy where users can create their accounts and buy electronic items from the website.
The website is built on using JavaScript, Java, Servlets, JSP, Bootstrap.
It contains Navigation bar, Search bar , Admin/manager page, payment gateway, analytics using Neo4j, Add/Delete/Edit product options.
Databases used are MongoDb, MYSQl.
Users can provide comments to the respective products and also provide ratings.
Based of users buying habits and most rated products  I am providing recommendations to the users about the possible likable product.
